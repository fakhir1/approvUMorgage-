      question: "How accurate are online mortgage calculators?",
      answer: "Online calculators provide excellent estimates, but your actual payments may vary based on your lender's specific terms, insurance requirements, and property taxes. Use calculators as a starting point and get pre-approved for exact figures."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in my mortgage payment?",
      answer: "Your mortgage payment typically includes principal and interest. However, some lenders require you to include property taxes and homeowner's insurance in your monthly payment. Condo fees are separate."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the mortgage stress test affect calculator results?",
      answer: "Our affordability calculator applies the stress test by qualifying you at a higher rate (your contract rate + 2% or 5.25%, whichever is higher). This ensures you can afford payments if rates increase."

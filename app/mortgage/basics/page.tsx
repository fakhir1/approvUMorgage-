    question: "What's the difference between mortgage term and amortization?",
    answer:
      "The mortgage term is the length of your current mortgage agreement (typically 1-10 years), while amortization is the total time it takes to pay off the entire mortgage (usually 25-30 years). You'll renew your mortgage several times over the amortization period.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need mortgage insurance?",
    answer:
      "CMHC or other mortgage default insurance is required if your down payment is less than 20% of the home's value. This insurance protects the lender if you default. With 20%+ down payment, you can avoid this insurance premium.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch mortgage types during my term?",
    answer:
      "Switching from variable to fixed (or vice versa) during your term is possible but usually involves breaking your mortgage contract, which can result in penalties. Some lenders offer more flexible conversion options.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens at mortgage renewal?",
    answer:
      "At the end of your term, you can renew with your current lender, switch to a new lender, or pay off the remaining balance. This is an opportunity to renegotiate your rate and terms without penalties.",
